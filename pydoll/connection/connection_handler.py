class ConnectionHandler:

    Manages WebSocket connections to Chrome DevTools Protocol endpoints.

    This class establishes and maintains WebSocket connections to either browser-level
    or page-level CDP endpoints, providing a reliable communication channel for sending
    commands and receiving events and responses. It handles connection lifecycle,
    message routing, and event subscription.

    Key responsibilities:
    1. Establishing and maintaining WebSocket connections
    2. Sending CDP commands and handling responses
    3. Managing event subscriptions and callbacks
    4. Processing incoming messages (both command responses and events)
    5. Handling connection interruptions and reconnection

    This is a core component of the automation framework, acting as the communication
    layer between Python code and the browser's DevTools Protocol.
