    Manages browser process lifecycle for CDP-based browser automation.
    
    This manager handles browser process creation, monitoring, and termination
    to ensure proper resource management during automation sessions. It provides:
    
    1. Configurable process creation with support for custom process handlers
    2. Standardized browser launch with CDP debugging port configuration
    3. Clean process termination with graceful shutdown attempts
    4. Resource cleanup to prevent orphaned processes
    
    The class serves as a critical component in the CDP automation flow by 
    maintaining the connection between the Python automation code and the 
    actual browser process running on the system.

        Launches a browser process with CDP debugging enabled.
        
        Starts the browser at the specified binary location, configures it
        to listen for CDP connections on the given port, and applies any
        additional browser-specific arguments. This creates the browser
        process that the CDP client will connect to.
        
        Args:
            binary_location: Absolute path to the browser executable.

            arguments: Additional command-line arguments to pass to the browser.
                These typically include configuration for headless mode, window size,
                user data directory, and other browser behavior settings.

        Attempts to cleanly shut down the browser process by first sending a
        termination signal (SIGTERM on Unix, taskkill on Windows) and waiting
        for the process to exit. If the browser doesn't exit within the timeout
        period, forces termination with a kill signal.

        1. Clean browser exit with proper profile saving when possible
